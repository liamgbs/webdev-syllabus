# Arrays

What if we want to hold a collection of data? We could do:

```javascript
let data1 = 10;
let data2 = 19;
let data3 = 129;
let data4 = 102;
let data5 = 404;
```

But then what if we had a million bits of data? It would get really hard to work with. So we have an **array** to hold data.

```javascript
let data = [10, 19, 129, 102, 404];

let empty = [];
```

We can access each bit of data by it's index in the array (from left to right). **Be aware that things in programming tend to start from 0**, this includes arrays.

```javascript
let data = [10, 19, 129, 102, 404];

const empty = [];

data[0] // 10
data[4] // 404
data[10] // undefined
```
