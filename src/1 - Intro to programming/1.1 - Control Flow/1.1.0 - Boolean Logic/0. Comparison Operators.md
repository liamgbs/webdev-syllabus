# Logical Operators

Now onto the interesting stuff. This is where you can make your programs make decisions based on **boolean** conditions. Remember, all boolean means is true or false. So, if true then do this, otherwise do that.

Full disclosure. This will be a big section, we need to cover both boolean operators and comparison operators (I will explain these terms with examples).

## Equality operator

So a simple if statement to start:

```javascript
let myBoolean = true;

if (myBoolean === true) {
    console.log("it was true");
}
```

You may have noticed the equality operator. A triple equals `===` means compare both sides and if they are correct then return `true`. This is your first boolean operator. We'll apply boolean logic in control flow using if statements in the next section.

```javascript
console.log(true === true) // true
console.log(true === false) // false
console.log(1 === 1) // true
console.log(10 === 5 + 5) // true
```

You can check anything with boolean operators, but we'll see that some things make a little more sense than others.

Object attributes:

```javascript
const ob = {
    attr: "hello"
}

console.log(ob.attr === "hello") // true
```

Array properties:

```javascript
const arr = [1,2,3,4];

console.log(arr.length === 4) // true
```

Logical operators are in the same ballpark as boolean operators. The difference is that with boolean operators you're checking the difference

# The rest of them

Theres no point in going through them one at a time from here. You've been to school and you know what less than and greater than symbols mean so lets just jump right in.

```javascript
console.log(1 < 3) // true

console.log(3 > 3) // false

console.log(3 <= 3) // true

console.log(5 >= 5) // true

```
