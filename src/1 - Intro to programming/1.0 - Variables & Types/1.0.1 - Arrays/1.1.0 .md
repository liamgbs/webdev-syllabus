# Arrays

What if we want to hold a collection of data? We could do:

```javascript
let data1 = 10;
let data2 = 19;
let data3 = 129;
let data4 = 102;
let data5 = 404;
```

But then what if we had a million bits of data? It would get really hard to work with. So we have an **array** to hold data.

```javascript
let data = [10, 19, 129, 102, 404];

let empty = [];
```
## Data Access

We can access each bit of data by it's index in the array (from left to right). **Be aware that things in programming tend to start from 0**, this includes arrays.

```javascript
let data = [10, 19, 129, 102, 404];

const empty = [];

data[0] // 10
data[4] // 404
data[10] // undefined
```

## Assignment

We can assign to the array in the same way that we assign to a regular variable:

```javascript
let data = [10, 19, 129, 102, 404];

data[2] = 0;

data[5] = "Hello!";

console.log(data); // [0, 19, 129, 102, 404, "Hello!"]
```

> Note that we can mix and match types in out array, for example I just put a string in an array full of numbers. This is sometimes a bad idea because it becomes harder to work with the contents.

## Intro to objects

We'll do more on objects in the next bit, but heres a primer. An **object** is a special type. An array is a type of object, but isn't actually an object... (very confusing but dont worry about it).
